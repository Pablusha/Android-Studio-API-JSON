# Where can you find the API?
Go to [FIXERIO](https://fixer.io) sign up and they will give it to you a api key.You can use that api key in that app.

# If you take a error at the showing the data in the logcat
You can check named "AndroidManifest.xml" folder.If you still get a error then i suggest check it the res/xml folder.
I know make this app is so easy.I just do it for understand the logical structure.
